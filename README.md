Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Network Optimization using Google OR Tools and Python.
The code shows how to solve Multi-Commodity Flow Assignment Problems:  

1. minCost_CFA.py: Capacity Flow Assignment problem (min. total network capacity needed)
2. minCost_CFA_MILP.py: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (min. total network capacity needed)
